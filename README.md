# Simple Weather App

## Project Information

I finally suffered from the *I do not have enough projects for my portfolio* syndrome and started embarking on a **project-based learning** journey. To make things simple, this means learning as you build projects. The first project is what you see in this repo.

## Hosting

I'll be composing my projects into a single portfolio soon, but for now, you can check the app on [GitHub Pages](https://markuptitan.github.io).

## Features

These features are somewhat the backbone of the functionality here:
1. **Error Handling for Incorrect City Names**: If you input a wrong city name, it will inform you that the city name is incorrect. This feature helps improve your spelling of certain cities.
2. **Empty Input Handling**: If you submit an empty input when searching for weather, the app will notify you.
3. **Dynamic Images**: Images change according to the weather. Currently, we have images for clear skies, clouds, rain, drizzle, and mist.
4. **Dark Mode and Light Mode**: Straightforward theme switching between dark mode and light mode.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Search Functionality**: Implementing features to avoid incorrect city names.
2. **Autofocus and Greeting**: Adding autofocus to the input field with a greeting text along with the user's name.
3. **Time-based Images**: Changing images according to the time of day.
4. **Persistent Dark/Light Mode**: Using cookies to remember user preferences for dark mode or light mode.

Most of these improvements will be achieved using cookies. I'm hoping this will be interesting.
